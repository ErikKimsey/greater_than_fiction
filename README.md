# 100W3rds
#### (For iOS and Android, via React-Native)

### 100W3rds was built to be a "creative aid".  A knocking-down of writer's block.


###### The Activity:
Prompted with 3 random words, the user has 5 minutes to write a short-story, essay, or poem.
Upon completion, the user has ripped through their creative block!  And has the option to save their creation as a JPEG on their mobile device.

###### Installation on your mobile device:
1. Download the Expo app from Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store.
2. Clone this repo to your computer.
3. From within the cloned repo's directory, run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run start`.
5. Within the terminal logs, a QR code should be displayed.
6. Open the Expo app on your mobile device.
7. Within Expo, select `"Scan QR Code"` and scan the QR code provided in your terminal.
8. Have scanned the QR code, Expo will begin building the 100W3rds application.
9. From there, simply follow the prompts!
